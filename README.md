The completed dissertation should be no more than 10,000 words (not including abstract, figures, tables and references). The precise length of your dissertation will be determined by how many words it takes you to: introduce your aims and objectives; set out satisfactorily the background context; describe and explain the methods; describe and present the results; provide in-depth discussion of the results; provide a synthesis with previous research; conclude the project in a clear and concise manner. Please discuss your text with your supervisor for more guidance. Please note that although you may have spent 100s of hours collecting excellent data if the dissertation is poorly written then it will not achieve a satisfactory grade.

Dissertation text should be double line spaced, in Times New Roman font size 12, with normal 2.54cm margins, and contain page numbers. Please consult your supervisor for any additional guidance specific to your project. 

**Supervisors may read and provide feedback on one complete draft of your project.**

The final report should be written in the form of a scientific thesis. All theses will be second marked.

The following assessments will be made by your supervisor and allocated second marker:

- **Abstract:** concise and accurate summary of the project
- **Introduction:** work placed in appropriate context; clear aims and hypotheses; comprehensive coverage of the relevant literature
- **Methods:** able to replicate experiment from description; techniques explained and understood; appropriate design to test stated hypotheses
- **Results:** appropriate methodologies (e.g. statistical tests) carried out; results effectively described to the reader highlighting relationships between variables; results presented clearly and in a logical order with appropriate figures and tables correctly captioned and labelled
- **Discussion:** clear interpretation that follows logically from the results; results discussed in wider context with reference to relevant literature; critical and thoughtful analysis showing clear insight and originality; logical suggestions for future research
- **Conclusion:** a concise reflection of the achievements of the project
- **Presentation and structure:** clear layout, well-structured with good English and grammar.
