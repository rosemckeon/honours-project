abstract = {Changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification of some animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. While the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. Here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. We present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4{\%} of speciation events in flowering plants and 7{\%} in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. Theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. The evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.},

abstract = {A linearity study of the propagation delay of bipolar circuits has been carried out using a SPICE program. It is found that the behavior of the propagation delay is quite linear and therefore analytical propaga- tion delay expressions for ECL and CML circuits are derived using a sensitivity analysis. The validity of these expressions is critically checked via SPICE simulations and experimental data published in the literature and agreement is obtained to 5{\%}. The propagation delay expression for CML circuits is published for the first time in the literature. These expressions indicate that there is an optimum value of load resistance for logic circuits in order to achieve a minimum propagation delay. For present technology, logic circuits for silicon transistors can operate at the current density of maximum fT, and logic circuits for AIGaAs/GaAs HBT should operate at a current density lower than that of maximum fT. Therefore, the paper points out that it is important to increase the collector current density of maximum fT for silicon bipolar circuits, or to decrease the base resistance R, and the forward transit time T{\~{}} for HBT circuits in order to increase the circuit speed.},

abstract = {A well-supported phylogeny is presented from both chloroplast DNA (the trnL/F region) and two regions of nuclear rDNA (ITS [internal transcribed spacer] and ETS [external transcribed spacer]) with nearly complete sampling for Mimulus (Phrymaceae) in western North America. Three separate genera are derived from within the clade that contains all the Mimulus species in western North America. The taxonomic status of the proposed sections of Mimulus and the relationships of many taxonomically difficult species are considered with observations on morphological evolution. Discordance between data sources provides support for the hypothesis that M. evanescens is a hybrid between M. latidens and M. breviflorus. In two major clades (Eunanus and Diplacus), patterns of genetic variation do not match the current taxonomy. The clustering of taxa in Eunanus is strongly associated with geographic distributions. Mimulus aurantiacus sensu Thompson, M. nanus, and M. floribundus are found to be progenitor species to other species that appear to be derived from within them. Polyploidy and aneuploidy events are clustered near the tips of the phylogeny. Thus, these two mechanisms are concluded to have played a relatively small role in the evolution of persistent lineages in Mimulus. The phylogenetic distribution of rare taxa is also examined.},

Among eukaryotes, polyploidy has probably had the largest evolutionary impact on vascular plants where many contemporary species are of recent polyploid origin. Genomic analyses have uncovered evidence of at least one round of polyploidy in the ancestry of most plants, fueling speculation that genome duplications lead to increases in net diversity. In spite of the frequency of ancient polyploidy, recent analyses have found that recently formed polyploid species have higher extinction rates than their diploid relatives. These results suggest that despite leaving a substantial legacy in plant genomes, only rare polyploids survive over the long term and most are evolutionary dead-ends.},

One contribution of 14 to a Theme Issue 'Contemporary and future studies in plant speciation, morphological/floral evolution and polyploidy: honouring the scientific contributions of Leslie D. Gottlieb to plant evolutionary biology'. Polyploidy is a mutation with profound phenotypic consequences and thus hypothesized to have transformative effects in plant ecology. This is most often considered in the context of geographical and environmental distributions as achieved from divergence of physiological and life-history traits-but may also include species interactions and biological invasion. This paper presents a historical overview of hypotheses and empirical data regarding the ecology of polyploids. Early researchers of polyploidy (1910s-1930s) were geneticists by training but nonetheless savvy to its phenotypic effects, and speculated on the importance of genome duplication to adaptation and crop improvement. Cytogenetic studies in the 1930s-1950s indicated that polyploids are larger (sturdier foliage, thicker stems and taller stature) than diploids while cytogeographic surveys suggested that polyploids and diploids have allopatric or parapatric distributions. Although autopolyploidy was initially regarded as common, influential writings by North American botanists in the 1940s and 1950s argued for the principle role of allopolyploidy; according to this view, genome duplication was significant for providing a broader canvas for hybridization rather than for its phenotypic effects per se. The emphasis on allopolyploidy had a chilling effect on nascent ecological work, in part due to taxonomic challenges posed by interspecific hybri-dization. Nonetheless, biosystematic efforts over the next few decades (1950s-1970s) laid the foundation for ecological research by documenting cytotype distributions and identifying phenotypic correlates of polyploidy. Rigorous investigation of polyploid ecology was achieved in the 1980s and 1990s by population biologists who leveraged flow cytometry for comparative work in autopolyploid complexes. These efforts revealed multi-faceted ecological and phenotypic differences, some of which may be direct consequences of genome duplication. Several classical hypotheses about the ecology of polyploids remain untested, however, and allopolyploidy-regarded by most botanists as the primary mode of genome duplication-is largely unstudied in an ecological context.},

abstract = {Polyploidization has long been recognized as an important force in the diversification of plants. Theoretical models predict that polyploids may be expected to exhibit higher rates of self-fertilization than do closely related diploid species. Wild populations of the neopolyploid Tragopogon mirus (4n) exhibited slightly higher rates of outcrossing than did populations of one of its progenitors, T. dubius (2n). In the current study, outcrossing rates in populations of T. dubius and T. mirus were estimated using artificial arrays constructed to maximize the chances of detecting outcrossing events. The artificial diploid population is more highly outcrossing (t = 0.727; family-level estimates range from 0.00 to 1.32) than the tetraploid population (t = 0.591; family-level estimates range from 0.00 to 1.14), although the difference between them is not statistically significant. The results of this study, combined with those of the previous work on wild populations, suggest that mating systems in these species vary more among populations than between ploidal levels. This could be because of the relatively recent origins of the tetraploid species; there may have been insufficient time since the formations of the tetraploids for shifts in mating systems to occur.},

Its adaptability to diverse environments and end uses is surprising given the diversity bottlenecks expected from recent domestication and polyploid speciation events. Wheat compensates for these bottlenecks by capturing part of the genetic diversity of its progenitors and by generating new diversity at a relatively fast pace. Frequent gene deletions and disruptions generated by a fast replacement rate of repetitive sequences are buffered by the polyploid nature of wheat, resulting in subtle dosage effects on which selection can operate.},

abstract = {Many species comprise multiple cytotypes that represent autopolyploids, or presumed autopolyploids, of the basic diploid cytotype. However, rarely has an autopolyploid been formally named and considered to represent a species distinct from its diploid progenitor (Zea diploperennis and Z. perennis represent a rare example). The major reasons why autopolyploids have not been named as distinct species are:(1) tradition of including multiple cytotypes in a single named species; and (2) tradition and convenience of adhering to a broad morphology-based taxonomic (or phenetic) species concept. As a result, plant biologists have underrepresented the distinct biological entities that actually exist in nature. Although it may seem “practical” to include morphologically highly similar cytotypes in one species, this practice obscures insights into evolution and speciation and hinders conservation. However, we do not suggest that all cytotypes should be named; each case must be carefully considered. A number of species comprising multiple cytotypes have been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on the literature, as well as our own experience with several autopolyploids (Tolmie a menziesii, Galax urceolata, Chamerion angustifolium, Heuchera grossulariifolia, Vaccinium cor ymbosum), we reassess the traditional view of plant autopolyploids as mere cytotypes. When considered carefully, many “unnamed” autopolyploids fulfill the requirements of multiple species concepts, including the biological, taxonomic, diagnosability, apomorphic, and evolutionary species concepts. Compared to the diploid parent, the autopolyploids noted above possess distinct geographic ranges, can be distinguished morphologically, and are largely reproductively isolated (via a diversity of mechanisms including reproductive and ecological isolation). These five autopolyploids (and probably many others) represent distinct evolutionary lineages; we therefore suggest that they be considered distinct species and also provide a system for naming them.},

abstract = {Inferences of whole genome duplication (WGD) events accompany the annotation of every newly sequenced plant genome, but much remains unknown about the evolutionary processes and pathways relating to WGD (Soltis et al. 2010). What ecological, biogeographical and genetic factors cause WGD to occur in nature? How does WGD affect gene expression? How do genomes evolve after WGD? New species that have arisen recently through WGD are good places to seek answers to such questions. These could be relatively common in nature, but reliably demonstrating their recent origin requires documentary evidence, which can be very hard to come by. Thus far, records of species introductions and meticulous botanizing have demonstrated six new natural allopolyploids in just four genera: Tragopogon miscellus and T. mirus, Senecio cambrensis and S. eboracensis, Spartina anglica and Cardamine schultzii (Abbott {\&} Rieseberg 2012; Ainouche et al. 2009; Soltis {\&} Soltis 2009). It is risky to generalize about a universal feature of plant evolution from such a small sample; more examples are needed, in different genera. It is therefore of considerable interest that Mario Vallejo-Marin of University of Stirling has this year named a new allopolyploid species of monkey flower, Mimulus peregrinus, and presented evidence that it is {\textless}140 years old (Vallejo-Marin 2012). This discovery is particularly timely as the monkey flower genus is developing rapidly as a model system for ecological genetics (Wu et al. 2008), and in the current issue of Molecular Ecology, Jennifer Modliszewski and John Willis of Duke University present new data showing high genetic diversity in another recently discovered monkey flower allopolyploid, M. sookensis (Modliszewski {\&} Willis 2012). {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {•Background: Biological invasions are a major ecological and socio-economic problem in many parts of the world. Despite an explosion of research in recent decades, much remains to be understood about why some species become invasive whereas others do not. Recently, polyploidy (whole genome duplication) has been proposed as an important determinant of invasiveness in plants. Genome duplication has played a major role in plant evolution and can drastically alter a plants genetic make-up, morphology, physiology and ecology within only one or a few generations. This may allow some polyploids to succeed in strongly fluctuating environments and/or effectively colonize new habitats and, thus, increase their potential to be invasive.•Scope: We synthesize current knowledge on the importance of polyploidy for the invasion (i.e. spread) of introduced plants. We first aim to elucidate general mechanisms that are involved in the success of polyploid plants and translate this to that of plant invaders. Secondly, we provide an overview of ploidal levels in selected invasive alien plants and explain how ploidy might have contributed to their success.•Conclusions: Polyploidy can be an important factor in species invasion success through a combination of (1) 'pre-adaptation', whereby polyploid lineages are predisposed to conditions in the new range and, therefore, have higher survival rates and fitness in the earliest establishment phase; and (2) the possibility for subsequent adaptation due to a larger genetic diversity that may assist the 'evolution of invasiveness'. Alternatively, polyploidization may play an important role by (3) restoring sexual reproduction following hybridization or, conversely, (4) asexual reproduction in the absence of suitable mates. We, therefore, encourage invasion biologists to incorporate assessments of ploidy in their studies of invasive alien species. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.},

abstract = {Competition, trophic interactions and abiotic disturbances play important roles in governing plant population dynamics, yet few studies have addressed their relative contributions or interacting effects. We used Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) analysis, coupled with stochastic analyses, to examine how a major abiotic disturbance, flooding, influences the fitness and population growth of a common riparian plant, Mimulus guttatus, and how this effect compares and interacts with that exerted by herbivory. We also extended LTRE analysis to include nested factors, which enabled us to examine differences across experimental sites. These spatial contributions to changes in population growth rate, $\lambda$, were compared and contrasted with those derived for year and experimental treatments. Flooding had direct positive impacts on population growth, while protection from herbivory benefited plants in both flooded and non-flooded areas. Spatial variation in plant performance was also substantial, with greater variation across experimental sites than temporal variation across years. Our stochastic analysis revealed that the impact of herbivores on population growth was much greater when the environment fluctuated between years with and without flooding than in more constant environments. Both flooding and herbivory exerted the majority of their impacts on plant performance via changes in adult summer survival. For flooded sites, this was surprising, given the small difference in summer survival between control and herbivore-exclusion treatments, and results from the high sensitivity of population growth to adult survival. The importance of herbivory in flooded sites would have not been discerned had we not considered how adult survival interacts with other stages of the M. guttatus life cycle. Thus, in order to increase ecological understanding associated with shifts in community dynamics, experimental results should be placed in a life-history context. Within disturbance-driven systems, the direct abiotic effects of factors such as flooding play a critical role in determining population dynamics. However, the biotic interactions that change as a consequence of disturbance can have equal and lasting impacts on population growth. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {The partial dominance model for the evolution of inbreeding depression predicts that tetraploids should exhibit less inbreeding depression than their diploid progenitors. We tested this prediction by comparing the magnitude of inbreeding depression in tetraploid and diploid populations of the herbaceous perennial Epilobium angustifolium (Onagraceae). Inbreeding depression was estimated in the greenhouse for three tetraploid and two diploid populations at four life stages. The mating system of a tetraploid population was estimated and compared to a previous estimate for diploids. Tetraploids showed less inbreeding depression than diploids at all life history stages, and these differences were significant for seed-set and cumulative fitness, but not for germination, survival, or plant dry mass at nine weeks. This result suggests that the genetic basis of inbreeding depression may differ among life stages. The primary selfing rate of the tetraploid population was r = 0.43, which is nearly identical to that of a diploid population (r = 0.45), indicating that differences in inbreeding depression between diploids and tetraploids are probably not due to differences in the mating system. Cumulative inbreeding depression, calculated from the four life history stages, was significantly higher for diploids ((x) over bar = 0.95) than for tetraploids ((x) over bar = 0.67), supporting the partial dominance model of inbreeding depression.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Genetic diversity in populations of invasive species is influenced by a variety of factors including reproductive systems, ploidy level, stochastic forces associated with colonization and multiple introductions followed by admixture. Here, we compare genetic variation in native and introduced populations of the clonal plant Oxalis pes-caprae to investigate the influence of reproductive mode and ploidy on levels of diversity. This species is a tristylous geophyte native to South Africa. Invasive populations throughout much of the introduced range are composed of a sterile clonal pentaploid short-styled form. We examined morph ratios, ploidy level, reproductive mode and genetic diversity at nuclear microsatellite loci in 10 and 12 populations from South Africa and the Western Mediterranean region, respectively. Flow cytometry confirmed earlier reports of diploids and tetraploids in the native range, with a single population containing pentaploid individuals. Introduced populations were composed mainly of pentaploids, but sexual tetraploids were also found. There was clear genetic differentiation between ploidy levels, but sexual populations from both regions were not significantly different in levels of diversity. Invasive populations of the pentaploid exhibited dramatically reduced levels of diversity but were not genetically uniform. The occurrence of mixed ploidy levels and stylar polymorphism in the introduced range is consistent with multiple introductions to the Western Mediterranean.

abstract = {▪ Abstract Here we review the biology of early generation neopolyploids and discuss the profound changes that accompany their formation. Newly formed auto- and allopolyploids exhibit considerable meiotic complexity, including multivalent pairing, multisomic inheritance, and the production of unbalanced gametes. The cytogenetic behavior of allopolyploids and autopolyploids differ statistically, but are more similar than commonly believed. The progeny of neopolyploids include a high frequency of aneuploids, pseudoeuploids and homeologue-recombinant genotypes that may contribute to the phenotypic variability observed in early generation polyploids. We find no evidence to support the traditional view that autopolyploids possess lower fertility than allopolyploids, casting doubt on the paradigm that allopolyploids should be more frequent due to their inherent fertility. The fertility of early generation polyploids increases rapidly, owing largely to selection against meiotic configurations that generate unbala...},

We then outline how genomics can allow or improve parameter estimation for PVA models by providing genotypic information at large numbers of loci for neutral and functional genome regions.

abstract = {▪ Abstract Polyploidy is widely acknowledged as a major mechanism of adaptation and speciation in plants. The stages in polyploid evolution include frequent fertility bottlenecks and infrequent events such as gametic nonreduction and interspecific hybridization, yet little is known about how these and other factors influence overall rates of polyploid formation. Here we review the literature regarding polyploid origins, and quantify parameter values for each of the steps involved in the principal pathways. In contrast to the common claim that triploids are sterile, our results indicate that the triploid bridge pathway can contribute significantly to autopolyploid formation regardless of the mating system, and to allopolyploid formation in outcrossing taxa. We estimate that the total rate of autotetraploid formation is of the same order as the genic mutation rate (10−5), and that a high frequency of interspecific hybridization (0.2{\%} for selfing taxa, 2.7{\%} for outcrossing taxa) is required for the rate of t...},

abstract = {Although plant breeding systems are evolutionarily labile, a shift from one system to another can involve formidable ecological obstacles. In order for gynodioecy to evolve from hermaphroditism, the carriers of a male-sterility mutation (i.e., females) must overcome two major hurdles: females must attract pollinators without offering pollen as a reward, and they must produce enough seeds to compensate for the loss of reproduction through the paternal route. We investigated the relative performance of female and hermaphroditic plants in a greenhouse study of Mimulus guttatus originating from a largely hermaphroditic population. Females had larger floral displays than did hermaphrodites, with 5{\%} wider corollas and 34{\%} more flowers open at one time. They also produced 22{\%} more flowers over a lifetime and 25{\%} more ovules per ovary than hermaphrodites, giving females 1.53 times more maternal reproductive potential. In a related experiment, bumblebees visited female plants just as frequently as hermaphroditic plants, even though the females offered no pollen reward. Although the relative advantages enjoyed by females may be insufficient to overcome the obstacles for the evolution of stable gynodioecy, they might be strong enough to explain the maintenance of genetic variation for male-sterility alleles often observed in natural populations of M. guttatus. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Aim: Newly formed polyploids experience problems of establishment and spread similar to those faced by newly introduced alien species. To understand the significance of polyploidy in biological invasions, we mapped the distribution of ploidy levels in Solidago gigantea Aiton in its native range in North America, and in Europe and East Asia where it is invasive. Location: North America, Europe and East Asia. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to measure ploidy levels in a total of 834 plants from 149 locations. Together with data from contributors and a literature review, ploidy-level data were assembled for 336 locations. Cytogeographical maps from North America and Europe were prepared, incorporating new and previously published ploidy-level data. Results: In the native range, diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid plants were found, and also one triploid and one pentaploid plant (2n = 3x and 2n = 5x, respectively, each being new reports for this species). There was a high degree of geographical separation among the ploidy levels, and populations with mixed ploidy were rare. However, four zones were identified where plants of different ploidy could come into contact. In Europe and East Asia, only tetraploid plants were found. Main conclusions: The geographical pattern in North America suggests that the ploidy levels are ecologically differentiated, although further investigations are needed to identify the nature of these differences. Alien populations appear to be exclusively tetraploid, but it is not clear whether this is because tetraploids were selectively introduced or because diploids were unsuccessful. In any case, comparisons between native and introduced populations need to account for ploidy level. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

For instance, some salamanders, frogs, and leeches are polyploids. Many of these polyploid organisms are fit and well-adapted to their environments. In fact, recent findings in genome research indicate that many species that are currently diploid, including humans, were derived from polyploid ancestors (Van de Peer {\&} Meyer, 2005). These species that have experienced ancient genome duplications and then genome reduction are referred to as paleopolyploids.

abstract = {Polyploidy is rarer in animals than in plants. Why? Since Muller's observation in 1925, many hypotheses have been proposed and tested, but none were able to completely explain this intriguing fact. New genomic technologies enable the study of whole genomes to explain the constraints on or consequences of polyploidization, rather than focusing on specific genes or life history characteristics. Here, we review a selection of old and recent literature on polyploidy in animals, with emphasis on the consequences of polyploidization for gene expression patterns and genomic network interactions. We propose a conceptual model to contrast various scenarios for changes in genomic networks, which may serve as a framework to explain the different evolutionary dynamics of polyploidy in animals and plants. We also present new insights of genetic sex determination in animals and our emerging understanding of how animal sex determination systems may hamper or enable polyploidization, including some recent data on haplodiploids. We discuss the role of polyploidy in evolution and ecology, using a gene regulation perspective, and conclude with a synopsis regarding the effects of whole genome duplications on the balance of genomic networks.

abstract = {Chromosome evolution in flowering plants is often punctuated by polyploidy, genome duplication events that fundamentally alter DNA content, chromosome number, and gene dosage. Polyploidy confers postzygotic reproductive isolation and is thought to drive ecological divergence and range expansion. The adaptive value of polyploidy, however, remains uncertain; ecologists have traditionally relied on observational methods that cannot distinguish effects of polyploidy per se from genic differences that accumulate after genome duplication. Here I use an experimental approach to test how polyploidy mediates ecological divergence in Achillea borealis (Asteraceae), a widespread tetraploid plant with localized hexaploid populations. In coastal California, tetraploids and hexaploids occupy mesic grassland and xeric dune habitats, respectively. Using field transplant experiments with wild-collected plants, I show that hexaploids have a fivefold fitness advantage over tetraploids in dune habitats. Parallel experiments with neohexaploids--first-generation mutants screened from a tetraploid genetic background--reveal that a 70{\%} fitness advantage is achieved via genome duplication per se. These results suggest that genome duplication transforms features of A. borealis in a manner that confers adaptation to a novel environment.},

In Solanaceae, a multiallelic gene, S-locus F-box (SLF), was previously shown to encode the pollen determinant in self-incompatibility. It was postulated that an SLF allelic product specifically detoxifies its non-self S-ribonucleases (S-RNases), allelic products of the pistil determinant, inside pollen tubes via the ubiquitin - 26S-proteasome system, thereby allowing compatible pollinations. However, it remained puzzling how SLF, with much lower allelic sequence diversity than S-RNase, might have the capacity to recognize a large repertoire of non-self S-RNases. We used in vivo functional assays and protein interaction assays to show that in Petunia, at least three types of divergent SLF proteins function as the pollen determinant, each recognizing a subset of non-self S-RNases. Our findings reveal a collaborative non-self recognition system in plants.},

abstract = {Polyploidy, the presence of more than two chromosome sets, is common in plants, but extremely rare in animals. The absence of polyploid organisms with well-differentiated sex chromosomes suggests that the disruption of the dosage between autosomes and sex chromosomes is incompatible with normal development. Thus, the announcement in 1999 of tetraploidy in a mammal, the South American red vizcacha rat Tympanoctomys barrerae, provoked great interest, even though the definitive proof of tetraploidy, the presence of four copies of each chromosome, was never provided. Here we used classical and molecular cytogenetics to test the ploidy level of T. barrerae and demonstrate that only two copies of each chromosome are present in this karyotype. The red vizcacha rat is clearly diploid and the amplification and dispersion of repetitive sequences best explain the large genome size of this mammal. Thus, polyploidy in mammals remains as unlikely as it has always been. Published by Elsevier Inc. The South American red vizcacha rat, Tympanoctomys barrerae, has the highest chromosome number (2n = 102) [1] and the largest genome size yet described among mammals [2]. It is a member of the family Octodontidae, a taxon that comprises 12 species of endemic, monophyletic South American rodents [3-8]. Octodontidae diploid numbers range from 2n = 38 to 2n = 102, with a median of 54-58 chromosomes. Common features of Octodontidae karyotypes include the presence of mostly bi-armed chromosomes, pericentro-meric constitutive heterochromatin, and a marker autosome pair with a nucleolus organizer region (NOR). Karyotypic studies in Octodontidae have been restricted to conventionally stained and C-banded karyotypes [2,8,9], methods that provide only limited karyotypic information. Molecular cytogenetic and longitudinal banding methods, which provide much more detail, have never been reported for any Octodontidae. We used several cytogenetic approaches to test the ploidy level of T. barrerae (2n = 102) and to dissect the composition of its extremely large genome. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with individual chromosome probes (chromosome painting) of Octodon degus, a related species with 2n = 58, the proposed ancestral diploid number for all Octodontidae [8]. We used total genomic DNA of both rodent species as probes for FISH to assess the degree of homology between their genomes, and we hybridized a limited number of human chromosome paints to T. barrerae cells. The molecular cytogenetic analysis of T. barrerae chromosomes was complemented with G banding. Results and discussion DNA from flow-sorted chromosomes of O. degus was used as probes for FISH. The chromosome content of the 25 sorted peaks was established by hybridizing back to O. degus metaphases (Fig. 1). Not all peaks contained single chromosomes, but good paints were obtained for 19 chromosomes. Some chromosomes were found in two peaks (i.e., pairs 1 and 5), showing a notable hetero-morphism in DNA content of some homologue pairs of O.},

abstract = {Pollinators often visit several flowers in sequence on plants with large floral displays. This foraging pattern is expected to influence the rate of self-fertilization in self-compatible taxa. To quantify the effects of daily floral display on pollinator movements and selfing, we experimentally manipulated flower number in four replicate (cloned) arrays of Mimulus ringens (Scrophulariaceae), each consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. Four display classes (two, four, eight and 16 flowers) were present in each array. Pollinator visitation rate per flower and seed set per fruit were unaffected by display. However, flower number strongly influenced the frequency of within-plant pollinator movements, which increased from 13.8{\%} of probes on two-flower displays to 77.6{\%} of probes on 16-flower displays. The proportion of within-plant movements was significantly correlated with selfing (r=0.993). The increase from 22.9{\%} selfing on two-flower displays to 37.3{\%} selfing on 16-flower displays reflects changes in the extent of geitonogamous self-pollination. We estimate that approximately half of all selfing on 16-flower displays resulted from geitonogamy. Selfing also varied dramatically among fruits within display classes. Nested ANOVA indicates that differences among flowers on two-flower ramets accounted for 45.4{\%} of the variation in selfing, differences among genets accounted for 16.1{\%} of the variation, and statistical and sampling error accounted for 38.5{\%} of the variation. Differences among flowers within ramets may reflect the order of sequential floral probes on a display.},

The success of angiosperms has been attributed, in part, to innovations associated with gene or whole-genome duplications, but evidence for proposed ancient genome duplications pre-dating the divergence of monocots and eudicots remains equivocal in analyses of conserved gene order. Here we use comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of sequenced plant genomes and more than 12.6 million new expressed-sequence-tag sequences from phylogenetically pivotal lineages to elucidate two groups of ancient gene duplications-one in the common ancestor of extant seed plants and the other in the common ancestor of extant angiosperms. Gene duplication events were intensely concentrated around 319 and 192 million years ago, implicating two WGDs in ancestral lineages shortly before the diversification of extant seed plants and extant angiosperms, respectively. Significantly, these ancestral WGDs resulted in the diversification of regulatory genes important to seed and flower development, suggesting that they were involved in major innovations that ultimately contributed to the rise and eventual dominance of seed plants and angiosperms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Polyploidy, or the presence of two or more diploid parental genome sets within an organism, is found to an amazing degree in higher plants. In addition, many plant species traditionally considered to be diploid have recently been demonstrated to have undergone rounds of genome duplication in the past and are now referred to as paleopolyploids. Polyploidy and interspecific hybridisation (with which it is often associated) have long been thought to be important mechanisms of rapid species formation. The widespread occurrence of polyploids, which are frequently found in habitats different from that of their diploid progenitors, would seem to indicate that polyploidy is associated with evolutionary success in terms of the ability to colonise new environmental niches. A flurry of recent genomic studies has provided fresh insights into the potential basis of the phenotypic novelty of polyploid species. Here we review current knowledge of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes associated with polyploidy in plants and assess how these changes might contribute to the evolutionary success of polyploid plants. We conclude by stressing the need for field-based experiments to determine whether genetic changes associated with polyploidy are indeed adaptive.},

abstract = {Breeding systems are important, and often neglected, aspects of the natural biology of organisms, affecting homozygosity and thus many aspects of their biology, including levels and patterns of genetic diversity and genome evolution. Among the different plant mating systems, it is useful to distinguish two types of systems: 'sex systems', hermaphroditic versus male/female and other situations; and the 'mating systems' of hermaphroditic populations, inbreeding, outcrossing or intermediate. Evolutionary changes in breeding systems occur between closely related species, and some changes occur more often than others. Understanding why such changes occur requires combined genetical and ecological approaches. I review the ideas of some of the most important theoretical models, showing how these are based on individual selection using genetic principles to ask whether alleles affecting plants' outcrossing rates or sex morphs will spread in populations. After discussing how the conclusions are affected by some of the many relevant ecological factors, I relate these theoretical ideas to empirical data from some of the many recent breeding system studies in plant populations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Polyploidy has been a common process during the evolution of eukaryotes, especially plants, leading to speciation and the evolution of new gene functions. Gene expression levels and patterns can change, and gene silencing can occur in allopolyploids--phenomena sometimes referred to as "transcriptome shock." Alternative splicing (AS) creates multiple mature mRNAs from a single type of precursor mRNA. Here we examined the evolution of AS patterns after polyploidy, with natural and two resynthesized allotetraploid Brassica napus lines, using RT-PCR and sequencing assays of 82 AS events in duplicated gene pairs (homeologs). Comparing the AS patterns between the two homeologs in natural B. napus revealed that many of the gene pairs show different AS patterns, with a few showing variation that was organ specific or induced by abiotic stress treatments. In the resynthesized allotetraploids, 26-30{\%} of the duplicated genes showed changes in AS compared with the parents, including many cases of AS event loss after polyploidy. Parallel losses of many AS events after allopolyploidy were detected in the two independently resynthesized lines. More changes occurred in parallel between the two lines than changes specific to each line. The PASTICCINO gene showed partitioning of two AS events between the two homeologs in the resynthesized allopolyploids. AS changes after allopolyploidy were much more common than homeolog silencing. Our findings indicate that AS patterns can change rapidly after polyploidy, that many genes are affected, and that AS changes are an important component of the transcriptome shock experienced by new allopolyploids.},

However, such adaptations do not prevent the transfer of pollen between flowers on the same plant (geitonogamy). Recent empirical studies, aided by advances in field techniques, statistical methods and modelling, show that geitonogamy often is substantial and increases with plant size. Selfing by geitonogamy incurs a fitness cost of reduced pollen export, and recent reports show that seed set can suffer as well, even in self-incompatible species. Geitonogamy has important implications for sex-allocation theory, the evolution of dioecy and other issues in evolutionary biology. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

These duplicates have contributed to the evolution of novel functions, such as the production of floral structures, induction of disease resistance, and adaptation to stress. Additionally, recent whole-genome duplications that have occurred in the lineages of several domesticated crop species, including wheat (Triticum aestivum), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and soybean (Glycine max), have contributed to important agronomic traits, such as grain quality, fruit shape, and flowering time. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and impacts of gene duplication will be important to future studies of plants in general and of agronomically important crops in particular. In this review, we survey the current knowledge about gene duplication, including gene duplication mechanisms, the potential fates of duplicate genes, models explaining duplicate gene retention, the properties that distinguish duplicate from singleton genes, and the evolutionary impact of gene duplication.},

abstract = {Genome duplication (polyploidy) is a recurrent evolutionary process in plants, often conferring instant reproductive isolation and thus potentially leading to speciation. Outcome of the process is often seen in the field as different cytotypes co-occur in many plant populations. Failure of meiotic reduction during gametogenesis is widely acknowledged to be the main mode of polyploid formation. To get insight into its role in the dynamics of polyploidy generation under natural conditions, and coexistence of several ploidy levels, we developed a general gametic model for diploid-polyploid systems. This model predicts equilibrium ploidy frequencies as functions of several parameters, namely the unreduced gamete proportions and fertilities of higher ploidy plants. We used data on field ploidy frequencies for 39 presumably autopolyploid plant species/populations to infer numerical values of the model parameters (either analytically or using an optimization procedure). With the exception of a few species, the model fit was very high. The estimated proportions of unreduced gametes (median of 0.0089) matched published estimates well. Our results imply that conditions for cytotype coexistence in natural populations are likely to be less restrictive than previously assumed. In addition, rather simple models show sufficiently rich behaviour to explain the prevalence of polyploids among flowering plants.},

One possibility, which has not been previously evaluated theoretically, is that novel polyploid lineages are initially more resistant to pathogens than the diploid progenitor species. Here, we explore this possibility by developing and analysing mathematical models of interactions between newly formed polyploid lineages and their pathogens. We find that for the genetic mechanisms of pathogen resistance with the best empirical support, newly formed polyploid populations of hosts are expected to be more resistant than their diploid progenitors. This effect can be quite strong and, in the case of perennial species with recurrent polyploid formation, may last indefinitely, potentially providing a general explanation for the successful establishment of novel polyploid lineages. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

In contrast to other speciation mechanisms, polyploid species begin with substantial postzygotic reproductive isolation from progenitors while being sympatric with one or both. These nascent polyploid species often go extinct due to ecological and evolutionary genetic obstacles. Interestingly, polyploid species appear to quickly occupy different geographic distributions and ecological niches than their diploid progenitors. Using biogeographic data from polyploid and diploid species representing 49 genera of vascular plants, we tested whether climatic niches of polyploid species evolve faster than their diploid relatives. We found polyploid species often have less climatic overlap than expected with diploid progenitors. Consistent with this pattern, we estimated that the climatic niches of polyploid plants consistently evolved faster than the niches of diploid relatives. Our results indicate ecological niche differentiation is important for polyploid establishment, and suggest ecological differentiation is important for speciation processes more widely.},

abstract = {An approach was made to the problem of estimating rates of chromosomal evolution in plants. This was done by considering variability in chromosome number within genera whose ages are known approximately from fossil and biogeographic evidence. The relative increases in chromosome number diversity per lineage per unit time were as follows: herbaceous angiosperms, 100; woody angiosperms, 14; conifers, 2; and cycads, 0. Rates of increase in species diversity were estimated in an analogous way. These rates were strongly correlated with the karyotypic rates.These evolutionary rate differences between major groups of seed plants are largely explicable in terms of the breeding structures of populations. Herbs usually have small to moderate effective population sizes, and relatively high dispersability. By contrast, woody angiosperms and gymnosperms are usually obligate outbreeders with large effective population sizes and low dispersability. Thus the probability of fixing and dispersing new karyotypes or novel character ensembles is higher in herbs than in other seed plants.},

We used a common garden transplant experiment to compare the relative fitnesses of native vs foreign genotypes at three nested ecological scales within Mimulus guttatus: annual vs perennial life history races, perennial ecotypes across an elevational range, and populations within perennial elevational ecotypes. We integrated fitness across the life-cycle and decomposed LA vs FA into contributions from different fitness components. We found LA, measured as home-site advantage, between annual and perennial races and a trend towards LA among populations within montane habitats.

abstract = {The prevalence of polyploidy among flowering plants is surprising given the hurdles impeding the establishment and persistence of novel polyploid lineages. In the absence of strong assortative mating, reproductive assurance, or large intrinsic fitness advantages, new polyploid lineages face almost certain extinction through minority cytotype exclusion. Consequently, much work has focused on a search for adaptive advantages associated with polyploidy such as increased competitive ability, enhanced ecological tolerances, and increased resistance to pathogens. Yet, no consistent adaptive advantages of polyploidy have been identified. Here, to investigate the potential for autopolyploid establishment and persistence in the absence of any intrinsic fitness advantages, we develop a simulation model of a diploid population that sporadically gives rise to novel autopolyploids. The autopolyploids have only very small levels of initial assortative mating or niche differentiation, generated entirely by dosage effects of genome duplication, and they have realistic levels of reproductive assurance. Our results show that by allowing assortative mating and competitive interactions to evolve, establishment of novel autopolyploid lineages becomes common. Additional scenarios where adaptive optima change over time reveal that rapid environmental change promotes the replacement of diploid lineages by their autopolyploid descendants. These results help to explain recent empirical findings that suggest that many contemporary polyploid lineages arose during the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction, without invoking adaptive advantages of polyploidy. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

Ledyard Stebbins, Jr., an architect of the Modern Synthesis, elegantly addressed a broad range of topics, from genes to chromosomes to deep phylogeny, but some of his most lasting insights came in the study of polyploidy. Here, we review the immense impact of his work on polyploidy over more than 60 years, from his entrance into this fledgling field in the 1920s until the end of his career. Stebbins and his contemporaries developed a model of polyploid evolution that persisted for nearly half a century. As new perspectives emerged in the 1980s and new genetic tools for addressing key aspects of polyploidy have become available, a new paradigm of polyploidy has replaced much of the Stebbinsian framework. We review that paradigm shift and emphasize those areas in which the ideas of Stebbins continue to propel the field forward, as well as those areas in which the field was held back; we also note new directions that plant geneticists and evolutionists are now exploring in polyploidy research. Perhaps the most important conclusion from recent and ongoing studies of polyploidy is that, following Levin and others, polyploidy may propel a population into a new adaptive sphere given the myriad changes that accompany genome doubling. {\textcopyright} 2014 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been a tremendous resurgence of interest in polyploidy that has in large part been stimulated by the development of increasingly powerful genetic and genomic tools. The result has been numerous new insights into the genomic and genetic consequences of polyploidy. The plethora of new discoveries has dramatically reshaped traditional views and concomitantly revealed that polyploidy is a highly dynamic and ubiquitous process. These recent advances in our understanding of polyploidy have stimulated numerous reviews, most focused on the various genetic, epigenetic, and genomic consequences of polyploid evolution. Whereas genetic and genomic attributes of polyploidization have received considerable attention, other crucial areas of polyploid evolution have received much less (e.g., ecology, pollination biology, physiology). The focus of this paper is not to review again recent discoveries, but to emphasize what we do not yet know about polyploidy, which despite all that has been learned about genome doubling is still an enormous amount. Our list is not meant to be comprehensive, but includes a range of topics that we have placed in several general categories, including mode of formation, ecological and physiological consequences, and genomic rules. Questions include: What is (are) the most frequent mechanism(s) of polyploidization? What factors promote/facilitate polyploidization? What factors favor autopolyploid vs. allopolyploid formation? Do multiple origins result in lineages with differing evolutionary trajectories and/or cryptic species? Our major goals are to stimulate discussion and promote further research.},

abstract = {Inbreeding depression is likely to be a common selective force opposing the automatic selective advantage of self-fertilization in self-compatible plants and animals, yet relatively few studies have measured both the breeding system and inbreeding depression in natural populations. In this study, I estimated the frequency of selfing, using data obtained by gel electrophoresis, in two annual populations of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus for 2 years, and measured the relative performance of selfed and outcrossed progeny over several stages of the life cycle in both the field and the greenhouse. Rates of outcrossing were not significantly different from 1.0 in either population in 1989, but both populations exhibited significant and moderate amounts of selfing in 1990. Outcrossing rates were significantly different between years for the Cone Peak population but not for the Iron Mountain population. Significant inbreeding depression was detected for almost every component of fitness measured, including germination success, survival to flowering, and flower, fruit and seed production in the native field environments for both populations. The final cumulative value of inbreeding depression, calculated as one minus the relative total seed production of selfed to outcrossed progeny, was 0.69 for Iron Mountain and 0.64 for Cone Peak. Inbreeding depression was also severe in the greenhouse experiments, even though fitness components only up to flower production were measured: 0.52 for Iron Mountain and 0.48 for Cone Peak. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of the magnitude of inbreeding depression in primarily outcrossing populations, and indicate that inbreeding depression is an important factor in the maintenance of outcrossing in these populations. {\textcopyright} 1993 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.},

abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is recognized as a potentially destructive process that represents a major threat to biodiversity [1-3]. The rate of population displacement by hybridization can be rapid, but underlying mechanisms are often obscure. One hypothesis is that a species may be driven to extinction by interspecific gene flow, or pollen swamping, when hybrids are inviable or sterile [1-3]. Here, we document the rapid movement of two zones of contact between monoecious hexaploid and dioecious diploid populations of the wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua (Euphorbiaceae) in northeastern and northwestern Spain, where diploids have displaced hexaploids by about 80 and 200 km, respectively, over a period of four decades. By using experimental mating arrays, we show that hybridization is highly asymmetrical in favor of the diploids, mainly because they disperse substantially more pollen, as expected in a comparison between an obligate outcrosser and a facultative selfer [4-6]. Self-fertilization, which is expected to reduce the proportion of sterile hybrids produced in mixed ploidy populations [7-11], allowed the hexaploids to avoid the effects of pollen swamping only slightly, and in a density-dependent manner. Our results thus provide a mechanistic explanation for the rapid movement of both contact zones of M. annua in Spain. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hybridisation between genetically divergent populations may lead to the formation of new evolutionary lineages. This may occur via the duplication of a hybrid's chromosome complement (allopolyploid speciation) or by the stabilisation of a fertile hybrid segregant (homoploid hybridspeciation). Although more common in plants, both modes of hybrid speciation also occur in animals, including fish, amphibians and insects. The successful origin and establishment of hybrid species is highly dependant on an ability to occupy novel and/or spatially isolated habitats, in order to escape the effects of competition and gene flow from parental species. This ability is favoured by the gen- eration of genetic novelty resulting from the dramatic effects that hybridisation (and genome duplication in allopolyploids) have on modifying genome structure and gene expression. Examples of new allopolyploid and homoploid hybrid species originating within the last 200– 300 years are important models for investigating processes involved in hybrid speciation and establishment.},

abstract = {• Researchers have hypothesized that self-compatibility (SC) should be more common in polyploid taxa than their diploid counterparts because of selection for reproductive assurance and/or the expected decline in inbreeding depression associated with having 'extra' gene copies. Support for this view has come from an observed breakdown of self-incompatibility (SI) in some species with a gametophytic system (GSI). The purpose of this research was to assess the strength of this relationship across a wider array of SI systems. • A large database, of diploid chromosome numbers, ploidy levels, and types of SI system, was assembled for angiosperm species and used to test for an association between ploidy and SC. • No strong association was found between SC and polyploidy at the level of species or families, and there was no evidence that those having a functional SI system also had fewer polyploid taxa or that most polyploids experience a breakdown in SI. • These results challenge the assumption that self-fertilization is strongly associated with polyploidy and suggest directions for further research on the evolution of polyploidy in relation to SI. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2004).},

abstract = {The magnitude of inbreeding depression can influence many aspects of a population's ecology and evolution, including the nature of selection acting on the mating system and the chances that the population will go extinct during periods of small population size. If inbreeding depression is caused primarily by recessive mutations of large effect on fitness, such as lethals or steriles, then it is expected to be purged rapidly by selection with moderate amounts of inbreeding. In contrast, inbreeding depression primarily caused by many genes with mild effects on fitness will not be rapidly purged with inbreeding, so it should be a more resilient barrier to the evolution of self-fertilization and a more significant threat to the survival of endangered species. Here I show that recessive male-sterility alleles at individual loci are common in a primarily outcrossing population of the plant Mimulus guttatus. Despite the high frequency of these major mutations, most of the inbreeding depression for male fertility and cumulative measures of lifetime fitness results from more mildly deleterious alleles. Male-sterility alleles contribute to 31{\%} of the inbreeding depression for the fraction of viable pollen grains, and to 26{\%} of the inbreeding depression for total fitness. These results suggest that most of the inbreeding depression for male fertility in this population would not be purged, in the short term, with moderate inbreeding.},

abstract = {The plant genus Mimulus is rapidly emerging as a model system for studies of evolutionary and ecological functional genomics. Mimulus contains a wide array of phenotypic, ecological and genomic diversity. Numerous studies have proven the experimental tractability of Mimulus in laboratory and field studies. Genomic resources currently under development are making Mimulus an excellent system for determining the genetic and genomic basis of adaptation and speciation. Here, we introduce some of the phenotypic and genetic diversity in the genus Mimulus and highlight how direct genetic studies with Mimulus can address a wide spectrum of ecological and evolutionary questions. In addition, we present the genomic resources currently available for Mimulus and discuss future directions for research. The integration of ecology and genetics with bioinformatics and genome technology offers great promise for exploring the mechanistic basis of adaptive evolution and the genetics of speciation. The broad goal of ecological and evolutionary functional genomics (EEFG) is to understand both the evolutionary processes that create and maintain genomic and pheno-typic diversity within and among natural populations and species, and the functional significance of such variation. For the first time, the tools of genomics allow researchers to address in a direct and meaningful way fundamental questions about adaptive evolution and the origin of biological diversity in natural settings. Historically, progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the genetics of adaptation and speciation has been slow. Technical limitations have restricted study to a small number of genes in a handful of model organisms. However, recent advances in our ability to characterize whole genomes and evaluate the functional significance of individual genes are rapidly changing the intellectual landscape. Furthermore, because the genomic tools and information developed in model systems can be increasingly extended to non-model species that are otherwise well suited for answering evolutionary questions, the challenge of understanding the molecular basis of evolution of natural populations and species can now be addressed. The process of creating a new model system particularly suitable for such synthetic EEFG studies is not trivial. Ideally such a species, or group of closely related species, should have attributes that allow for direct genetic and molecular analysis of important phenotypic variation. Clearly, it is important that the system be rich in ecologically and evolutionarily interesting traits, and that these traits vary between interfertile individuals. Because the expression of such fitness traits can vary depending on the environment (for example, Campbell and Waser, 2001), a comprehensive assessment of the adaptive significance of these traits also requires the ability to conduct experiments such as reciprocal transplants under natural field conditions. Incomplete reproductive isolation between important variants or species is necessary for genetic mapping, which can serve as a first step towards defining the genetic, and ultimately the molecular, basis of focal traits. Logistically, conducting such genetic studies requires a system with a reasonably short generation time, high fecundity and amenability to laboratory or greenhouse culture. Finally, for emerging model systems, substantial effort is required to develop the comprehensive genomic resources needed to investigate the molecular genetic basis of adaptation and speciation. Numerous highly polymorphic molecular markers are needed for genetic mapping of the genomic regions responsible for variation in ecologically interesting traits. If the genetic markers used for linkage mapping are also located on an ordered physical map of genomic clones, then it is possible to go from Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping of traits and subsequent fine-mapping to positional cloning and functional analysis of individual genes contributing to the phenotypic variation. To date, we are unaware of non-crop plant systems outside of Arabidopsis in which the genetic basis of natural phenotypic variation has been successfully identified using such an approach. The ultimate physical map, of course, is the entire sequenced genome, which if properly annotated with gene structure and functional information, can help identify candidate genes in genomic regions discovered through QTL mapping. The wildflower genus Mimulus (Phrymaceae ex. Scrophulariaceae) is one such new model system that is},

abstract = {Investigators have long searched for a polyploidy paradigm—rules or principles that might be common following polyploidization (whole-genome duplication, WGD). Here we attempt to integrate what is known across the more thoroughly investigated polyploid systems on topics ranging from genetics to ecology. We found that while certain rules may govern gene retention and loss, systems vary in the prevalence of gene silencing vs. homeolog loss, chromosomal change, the presence of a dominant genome (in allopolyploids), and the relative importance of hybridization vs. genome doubling per se. In some lineages, aspects of polyploidization are repeated across multiple origins, but in other species multiple origins behave more stochastically in terms of genetic and phenotypic change. Our investigation also reveals that the path to synthesis is hindered by numerous gaps in our knowledge of even the best-known systems. Particularly concerning is the absence of linkage between genotype and phenotype. Moreover, most recent studies have focused on the genetic and genomic attributes of polyploidy, but rarely is there an ecological or physiological context. To promote a path to a polyploidy paradigm (or paradigms), we propose a major community goal over the next 10-20 yr to fill the gaps in our knowledge of well-studied polyploids. Before a meaningful synthesis is possible, more complete data sets are needed for comparison—systems that include comparable genetic, genomic, chromosomal, proteomic, as well as morphological, physiological, and ecological data. Also needed are more natural evolutionary model systems, as most of what we know about polyploidy continues to come from a few crop and genetic models, systems that often lack the ecological context inherent in natural systems and necessary for understanding the drivers of biodiversity.},
