<!-- BD: You've identified several really relevant costs and benefits to polyploidy. I think it would be good to think about them all individually, and which ones you think are likely to be most important or most interesting. A good theory dissertation or manuscript doesn't need to look at everything. Actually, I think that a lot of really good theory work focuses on one mechanism of interest to understand it more clearly (much like an experiment might try to test how one factor affects something in a system). One useful approach for you might be to try pin down what you think is the most interesting process affecting polyploidy (after doing some background reading on each), or the one that sounds most suspicious (i.e., if you read something and think -- "that doesn't sound completely plausible -- what if x, y, or z?"). If you were to show, for example, that pollen swamping is unlikely under most conditions (all else being equal), that would be enough for a good paper. You could also think about interesting ways to link the costs and benefits -- maybe, e.g., pollen swamping is important because it is predicted to cause selection for reversal of selfing inhibition (again, all else being equal). --->

<!--- BD: I'm starting to think that it might help to narrow down a bit on one or two mechanisms that you find most interesting or potentially fruitful in terms of theoreticla questions. You've got a really good grasp of what ideas have been proposed for the costs and benefits of polyploidy. There are a lot of interesting places you can go to from here. The most difficult would be to introduce an entirely new idea of how polyploidy might arise and spread (new costs or benefits), assuming one(s) exists. The second most difficult would probably be to show that one or more of these costs and benefits hypothesised do not actually make sense -- i.e., that the prediction (hypothesis) does not follow logically from the starting assumptions. A bit more manageable for a dissertation would be to try to flesh out one or two of these mechanisms and ask some questions about the conditions that it specifically is predicted to contribute substantially to diversification of polyploids -- e.g., are there reasons to think that pollen swamping will lead to dead ends under some conditions, but diversification (or at least not dead ends) under others? --->

# Introduction {#intro}

Whole-genome duplication (polyploidisation) occurs due to errors during cell division, such as non-disjuntion. 
The result is either single cells or--when that cell is a gamete--whole organisms that become polyploid, and so posses more than two complete sets of chromosomes. 
In many taxa this mutation is not well tolerated; for instance, in humans whole-genome duplication accounts for around 5% of miscarriages [@REFNEEDED], and only one polyploid mammal has ever been recorded [@REFNEEDED]. 
However, the same is not so true of amphibians, fish, fungi and plants.

Polyploidy is exceptionally well tolerated in plants, being a ubiquitous feature in the lineages of almost all angiosperms [@Jiao2011], and having occured recently (post genera formation) for 35% of all vascular plants [@Wood2009]. 
Furthermore, @Jiao2011 also showed that whole-genome duplication could be linked with major innovation. 
Their phylogenetic analysis brought to light two ancient groups of duplication events (around 319 and 192 MYA). 
These events lead to the diversification of regulatory genes that were integral to seed development and later to genes that enabled flower development. 
Therefore, these duplications contributed to the appearance and success of all seed plants and angiosperms.

The process of whole-genome duplication is now thought to be fundamental in the diversification of plant species; having been found to coincide with 15% of angiosperm speciation events, and 31% of ferns [@Wood2009]. However, the situation is less clear-cut; according to @Mayrose2011 polyploidisation is critical in increasing speciation rates of diploids, but new polyploid lines don't further speciate by that same mechanism, and so their speciation rates are smaller in comparison. Furthermore, polyploid extinction rates are greater than those of diploids. This Liklihood-based analysis of vascualr plants provided the first quantitative support for the traditionally popular view that polyploidy most often leads to evolutionary dead ends.

However, despite having been studied for over a century, the factors that drive the success of polyploid establishment in the face of reproductive disadvantages and high extinction rates are still unclear. 
What is it that allows this extreme mutation to persist and become fixated within plant communities?

## Costs

@Arrigo2012 conclude that polyploids tend to become extinct at the establishment phase due to reproductive disadvantages such as triploid sterility, or limited mate-choice; the latter occuring via diploid pollen-swamping, or delayed flowering. By exploring each mechanism in more detail, we can start to get a feel for how they work, the conditions that will cause them to be important and, ultimately, whether or not they are realistic.

### Diploid Pollen-Swamping {#pollen-swamping}

### Delayed Flowering {#flowering}

### Triploid Sterility {#sterility}

## Benefits

Benefits associated with polyploidy may offset these costs: Polyploids are frequently linked with distinct traits such as "gigas effects", which include increases in plant organs, reversal of selfing inhibition, enhanced capabilities for buffering of deleterious mutation (due to increased heterozygosity), and hybrid vigour (heterosis) [@Woodhouse2009; @Ramsey2014]. 
These traits are thought to overcome the reproductive disadvantages of polyploidy and instead make this mutation key to the invasive and adaptive potential of plants, ultimately shaping broader patterns of plant diversification.

### Genetic buffering {#buffering}

## How do these mechanisms link?

> Does limited mate-choice set the scene for the evolution of selfing vs outcrossing?

> Delayed flowering (cost) is associated with gigas-effects of increased size (benefit). TRADE-OFF.
