The model results have shown that stable coexistence between diploids and polyploids is easily achievable despite the reproductive barriers which triploid sterility and pollen-swamping create. The estimated rate of actual nonreduction in non-hybrid angiosperms is 0.0056 [@Ramsey1998], well below the threshold rate where coexistence in this model became impossible. The flip side of this is that, based on these results, the natural rate is also far too low for polyploidy to reach fixation without some other force coming into play. The model showed how critical the relative abundance of viable polyploids was to achieving fixation of polyploidy, and how the booming populations of sterile polyploids interfered with the diploids in the population even more than the polyploids; the relative abundance of diploids declined in response to the competition from booms of sterile polyploids. 

In effect, the production of sterile offspring appeared to mediate the transition from a state of coexistence to one where polyploid fixation was possible. By competing with the abundant diploids for resources and reducing their numbers, the sterile population made the chance meeting of rare (unreduced) gametes more probable, by making them less rare. The mechanism by which polyploids are formed (nonreduction) both creates the effect of pollen-swamping and then also removes it. The rates at which this happened here were much higher than the nonreduction estimated for autopolyploids. However, the frequency of unreduced gametes in allopolyploids is thought to be around 50-fold greater [@Ramsey1998]. This rate of nonreduction (0.275) falls quickly with the range where we saw a reasonable chance of polyploid fixation. Even so, the type of fixation most often observed within that range was always unstable; only minimal numbers of polyploids persisted despite achieving fixation. In reality, populations of this size would be incredibly sensitive to environmental stochasticity; extinction would be likely.

If polyploids tend to become extinct at the establishment phase, as suggested by @Arrigo2012, then it follows that traits which increase reproductive assurance should lead to mitigation of extinction risk. Perhaps this is why the polyploids we see established in nature exhibit traits like increased body size, flower size, and number. As well as increasing potential fecundity, these traits should increase the probability of self-pollination between flowers on the same individual [@DeJong1993; @Karron2004]; further assuring reproductive output. In a system where there is a method of fragmenting the mating pool, polyploids could avoid swamping from incompatible pollen via self-fertilisation. In the model presented here, under the assumption that pollen range encompasses the entire landscape, the ability to self over not-self would not increase the chance of self gametes meeting. Pollen range would need to be reduced, or some compatibility assortment (such as flower timing or pollinator specificity) would need to evolve in order for selfing to be advantageous. In natural populations of *E. guttata*, flowering time variation is broad and has a genetic basis [@Monnahan2017]. Could this be a mechanism of fragmenting the fertile population? Furthermore, can variation in flowering time, or other compatibility assorting traits, cause an increased chance of polyploidy fixation? Or, will these mechanisms be equally likely to evolve in diploids too?

## Evolution of compatibility assortment

The increased size and stature of autopolyploids prolongs their development and leads to delayed flowering.  This delay could cause reproductive isolation by altering pollinator specificity or increasing selfing probability [@Ramsey2014]. While these effects may result in inbreeding and a loss of mates, rather than a cost, delayed flowering could also be thought of as a strategy to escape pollen swamping. 

If the model presented here were expanded so that the parental pool--which is sampled randomly to create seeds--was further subdivided depending on ploidy level, then fertilisation attempts would only be carried out between compatible individuals. Furthermore, the production of sterile offspring should be significantly reduced in this scenario. Consider a neotetraploid with delayed flowering; this individuals 2n gametes would no longer meet with haploid ones from the diploid population it arose in. Even its unreduced 4n gametes would not result in wasted effort, because the possible pairings would produce even-numbered ploidy offspring: 2n + 4n = 6x (hexaploid), or 4n + 4n = 8x (octoploid). Individuals could be given an inheritable trait value that denotes flowering time instead, to create more natural variation. Under these conditions, simulations could be used to test whether delayed flowering was more likely to evolve in polyploid or diploid lineages. 

## Selfing 

Where diploid *M. annua* displaced hexaploid relatives via pollen-swamping, selfing only minorly allowed the hexaploids to mitigate these effects. Escaping pollen-swamping in *M. annua*, via selfing, was density-dependent and slight [@Buggs2006]. Various mechanisms (of morphology, genetics or flower sex and timing) attempt to control self-incompatibility in angiosperms in order to limit the amount of inbreeding that can occur via self-pollination [@Silva2001]. If, or once, flowering time variation evolved in the model, to fragment the mating pool, then the ability to self may present polyploids with a further advantage.

According to @Ramsey2014, self-incompatibility has been broadly expected to occur more in polyploids, an idea first proposed by @Stebbins1950 as a route by which polyploids could alleviate issues of reproductive isolation. Additionally, the idea that multiple gene copies are thought to buffer against the deleterious effects of inbreeding depression has bolstered this theory [@Husband1997] and increased its popularity. There is some empirical evidence for increased selfing in angiosperm tetraploids [@Cook2000; @Husband1997], but a general pattern of association between polyploidy and selfing has not been found across a wide range of taxa [@Mable2004]. A possible explanation for the lack of a more general association could be down to the probability of selfing in polyploidy being inherently linked with flowers. Remember how autopolyploids produce more numerous and larger flowers? Moreover, how this increases the probability of selfing?

Variation in life-history strategy has been observed in *E. guttata*; two populations in Oregon were mostly outcrossing with fluctuating partial selfing [@Willis1993]. Could there be an association between the ability to self and the probability of stable fixation of polyploidy? Self-fertilisation could be restricted in the model to investigate this concept further. A trait which modifies the probability of selfing could be included to add the possibility of variation in selfing to evolve. The model could then be used to test whether selfing evolves in polyploids alongside flowering time variation, or whether it is dependent on that variation preceding it. 

## Triploid sterility

Because triploids and other odd-numbered ploidy levelled individuals, are *often* sterile, the model assumed complete triploid sterility for simplicity. The mechanisms by which triploid sterility appears are developmental defects that stop triploids even being produced, genomic instability between unevenly matched sets of chromosomes that cannot pair effectively, problems with gametogenesis that produces inviable pollen, or a lack of endosperm which is essential for seed development [@Costa2014; @Sonnleitner2013]. Based on this, the model made two assumptions regarding triploid sterility that could be improved:

1. All fertilisation attempts had an equal probability of success in producing offspring. 

    Gamete pairings that would produce triploids or other odd-numbered ploidy offspring would have the same chance of transitioning via germination as any other seed in the system, but this is not strictly true. Interploidy seed development is often disrupted so that the probability of producing viable triploid seeds is reduced. This reduction in seed output is termed the 'triploid block' [@Marks1966; @Ramsey1998]. 

2. All odd-numbered ploidy individuals were completely sterile. 

    In reality, this is not always strictly the case either; the reproductive potential of triploids can vary between species, by ploidy level, or by parental genome contribution. For example; the hybrid offspring of *E. guttata* and *Erythranthe peregrina* (formerly: *Mimulus peregrinus*) are sterile triploids with little potential for gene-flow [@Buggs2012], as are hybrids between *E. guttata* and *Erythranthe lutea* [@Vallejo-Marin2012]. In contrast, @Costa2014 show that odd-numbered ploidy types with more set of chromosomes (greater than 3) have reduced sterility; the extra gene contribution to endosperm made the seed production of pentaploids more effective than that of triploids. Furthermore, if the unreduced (larger) gamete is the maternal one, so there is a ratio of 2:1 maternal:paternal contribution of endosperm genes, then viable offspring can also be readily produced by triploids [@Lin1984]. 

## Diploidisation

All neopolyploids enter a period of diploidisation, by which duplicated genes are discriminantly lost. This process occurs via various mechanisms, over many generations, until a state of diploidy has returned [@Comai2005]. The model presented here included no rate or mechanism for this process. However, the diploidisation of neopolyploids would alter the mating dynamics in the system; relative abundances of reduced and unreduced gametes would change over time as polyploid lineages experienced this genetically reductive phase. Understanding how diploidisation alters the patterns of viable polyploid fixation and sterile polyploid abundance could further elucidate the real cost of pollen-swamping. Reduction of ploidy type towards diploid should constrain the diversity of ploidy types and increase the number of reduced gametes in the system. Would this increase the cost of pollen-swamping, and make the probability that unreduced gametes meet even more unlikely?

## Evolution of the rate itself

Mutation rates are known to evolve [@Lynch2010]. The rates of nonreduction vary between species [@Ramsey1998], and as the mechanisms of nonreduction are based on developmental defects in meiotic machinery, they are also likely to evolve. However, as the rate of nonreduction adds a negative pressure to the survival and reproduction of diploids, not just arising polyploids, this would theoretically constrain the rate. Higher rates of nonreduction in diploids are unlikely to evolve if they also reduce diploid fitness. Nevertheless, any polyploids which persist--either by chance or adaptation--would likely express higher rates of nonreduction, because the chance of fixation increased with rate alone. Successfully passing this trait on to viable offspring would pull the rate antagonistically upwards while the success of diploids would constrain it. 

## Observations in the wild

Even in the best-studied angiosperm systems, integration between genomic data and its ecological context has been lacking; this has hindered our ability to fully understand the driving forces in the evolution polyploidy [@Soltis2016a]. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that may be at play (such as evolution of the nonreduction rate, self-incompatibility, delayed flowering or increased germination probability), much work is being done to find and describe wild neopolyploid populations [@Ferrero2015; @Schlaepfer2008; @Simon-Porcar2017]. The processes of adaptation can be better examined now that recent polyploidisation has been found in the wild. To date, much of the data has had the accumulation of genetic change over large spans of evolutionary history clouding the picture. Wild study populations will better inform us of the ecological factors (such as; climate or predation pressure) which may be integral to understanding the fate neopolyploid lineages.
