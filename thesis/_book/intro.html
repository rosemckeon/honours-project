<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Polyploidy is well tolerated in plants, being a ubiquitous feature in the lineages of most plant taxa <span class="citation">(J. Ramsey and Ramsey <a href="#ref-Ramsey2014">2014</a>)</span>. While they have been studied for over a century, the factors that drive the success of polyploid establishment in the face of reproductive disadvantages and high extinction rates are still unclear. What is it that allows this extreme mutation to persist and become fixated within a population?</p>
<p>The process of whole-genome duplication is also thought to be fundamental in the diversification of plant species; having been found to coincide with around 25% of plant speciation events <span class="citation">(Wood et al. <a href="#ref-Wood2009">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure this figure is as correct as can be. Does it need the breakdown between different taxa?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a study by <span class="citation">Arrigo and Barker (<a href="#ref-Arrigo2012">2012</a>)</span> on the extinction rates of polyploids has suggested that many of these new lines are evolutionary dead ends<!--- BD: Ah, okay, here's more what I was looking for in terms of raitonale. So the idea is that polyploidy causes speciation, as evidence by speciation events in the phyolgeny appearing to coincide with increases in ploidy in new species? But @Arrigo2012 suggests that the newly formed polyploid species go extinct at a higher rate than non-polyploids? ---></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MORE DETAIL on evolutionary dead ends and exact extinction rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="costs" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Costs</h2>
<p>They conclude that polyploids tend to become extinct at the establishment phase due to reproductive disadvantages such as limited mate-choice (by diploid pollen-swamping, or delayed flowering), and triploid sterility. <!--- BD: Nice, this feels like the start of a good set up for an interesting theoretical question. I'm now wanting to know whether or not these proposed mechanisms conferring a reproductive disadvantage are realistic. This would also be a good place for some more theory and guided thought -- help me and the reader think more clearly about  these different mechanisms, and when (or whether) each might be important. I could imagine, potentially, an entire dissertation paragraph on each of these in the Introduction. ---></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Benefits</h2>
<p>Benefits associated with polyploidy may offset these costs: Polyploids are frequently linked with distinct traits such as “gigas effects”, which include increases in plant organs, reversal of selfing inhibition, enhanced capabilities for buffering of deleterious mutation (due to increased heterozygosity), and hybrid vigour (heterosis) <span class="citation">(Woodhouse, Burkart-Waco, and Comai <a href="#ref-Woodhouse2009">2009</a>; J. Ramsey and Ramsey <a href="#ref-Ramsey2014">2014</a>)</span>. These traits are thought to overcome the reproductive disadvantages of polyploidy and instead make this mutation key to the invasive and adaptive potential of plants, ultimately shaping broader patterns of plant diversification.</p>

<!-- BD: You've identified several really relevant costs and benefits to polyploidy. I think it would be good to think about them all individually, and which ones you think are likely to be most important or most interesting. A good theory dissertation or manuscript doesn't need to look at everything. Actually, I think that a lot of really good theory work focuses on one mechanism of interest to understand it more clearly (much like an experiment might try to test how one factor affects something in a system). One useful approach for you might be to try pin down what you think is the most interesting process affecting polyploidy (after doing some background reading on each), or the one that sounds most suspicious (i.e., if you read something and think -- "that doesn't sound completely plausible -- what if x, y, or z?"). If you were to show, for example, that pollen swamping is unlikely under most conditions (all else being equal), that would be enough for a good paper. You could also think about interesting ways to link the costs and benefits -- maybe, e.g., pollen swamping is important because it is predicted to cause selection for reversal of selfing inhibition (again, all else being equal). --->
</div>
<div id="or-how-do-these-mechanisms-link" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Or how do these mechanisms link?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Does limited mate-choice set the scene for the evolution of selfing vs outcrossing?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Delayed flowering (cost) is associated with gigas-effects of increased size (benefit). TRADE-OFF.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--- BD: I'm starting to think that it might help to narrow down a bit on one or two mechanisms that you find most interesting or potentially fruitful in terms of theoreticla questions. You've got a really good grasp of what ideas have been proposed for the costs and benefits of polyploidy. There are a lot of interesting places you can go to from here. The most difficult would be to introduce an entirely new idea of how polyploidy might arise and spread (new costs or benefits), assuming one(s) exists. The second most difficult would probably be to show that one or more of these costs and benefits hypothesised do not actually make sense -- i.e., that the prediction (hypothesis) does not follow logically from the starting assumptions. A bit more manageable for a dissertation would be to try to flesh out one or two of these mechanisms and ask some questions about the conditions that it specifically is predicted to contribute substantially to diversification of polyploids -- e.g., are there reasons to think that pollen swamping will lead to dead ends under some conditions, but diversification (or at least not dead ends) under others? --->
