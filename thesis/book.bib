abstract = {Polyploidy, the presence of more than two chromosome sets, is common in plants, but extremely rare in animals. The absence of polyploid organisms with well-differentiated sex chromosomes suggests that the disruption of the dosage between autosomes and sex chromosomes is incompatible with normal development. Thus, the announcement in 1999 of tetraploidy in a mammal, the South American red vizcacha rat Tympanoctomys barrerae, provoked great interest, even though the definitive proof of tetraploidy, the presence of four copies of each chromosome, was never provided. Here we used classical and molecular cytogenetics to test the ploidy level of T. barrerae and demonstrate that only two copies of each chromosome are present in this karyotype. The red vizcacha rat is clearly diploid and the amplification and dispersion of repetitive sequences best explain the large genome size of this mammal. Thus, polyploidy in mammals remains as unlikely as it has always been. Published by Elsevier Inc. The South American red vizcacha rat, Tympanoctomys barrerae, has the highest chromosome number (2n = 102) [1] and the largest genome size yet described among mammals [2]. It is a member of the family Octodontidae, a taxon that comprises 12 species of endemic, monophyletic South American rodents [3-8]. Octodontidae diploid numbers range from 2n = 38 to 2n = 102, with a median of 54-58 chromosomes. Common features of Octodontidae karyotypes include the presence of mostly bi-armed chromosomes, pericentro-meric constitutive heterochromatin, and a marker autosome pair with a nucleolus organizer region (NOR). Karyotypic studies in Octodontidae have been restricted to conventionally stained and C-banded karyotypes [2,8,9], methods that provide only limited karyotypic information. Molecular cytogenetic and longitudinal banding methods, which provide much more detail, have never been reported for any Octodontidae. We used several cytogenetic approaches to test the ploidy level of T. barrerae (2n = 102) and to dissect the composition of its extremely large genome. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with individual chromosome probes (chromosome painting) of Octodon degus, a related species with 2n = 58, the proposed ancestral diploid number for all Octodontidae [8]. We used total genomic DNA of both rodent species as probes for FISH to assess the degree of homology between their genomes, and we hybridized a limited number of human chromosome paints to T. barrerae cells. The molecular cytogenetic analysis of T. barrerae chromosomes was complemented with G banding. Results and discussion DNA from flow-sorted chromosomes of O. degus was used as probes for FISH. The chromosome content of the 25 sorted peaks was established by hybridizing back to O. degus metaphases (Fig. 1). Not all peaks contained single chromosomes, but good paints were obtained for 19 chromosomes. Some chromosomes were found in two peaks (i.e., pairs 1 and 5), showing a notable hetero-morphism in DNA content of some homologue pairs of O.},

abstract = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, followed by gene loss and diploidization has long been recognized as an important evolutionary force in animals, fungi and other organisms, especially plants. The success of angiosperms has been attributed, in part, to innovations associated with gene or whole-genome duplications, but evidence for proposed ancient genome duplications pre-dating the divergence of monocots and eudicots remains equivocal in analyses of conserved gene order. Here we use comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of sequenced plant genomes and more than 12.6 million new expressed-sequence-tag sequences from phylogenetically pivotal lineages to elucidate two groups of ancient gene duplications-one in the common ancestor of extant seed plants and the other in the common ancestor of extant angiosperms. Gene duplication events were intensely concentrated around 319 and 192 million years ago, implicating two WGDs in ancestral lineages shortly before the diversification of extant seed plants and extant angiosperms, respectively. Significantly, these ancestral WGDs resulted in the diversification of regulatory genes important to seed and flower development, suggesting that they were involved in major innovations that ultimately contributed to the rise and eventual dominance of seed plants and angiosperms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification ofsome animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. While the preva- lence ofpolyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on pat- terns and rates ofdiversification remains an open question. Here we reviewevidence for the creative role ofpolyploidy in evolution.We present new estimates for the incidence ofpolyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transi- tions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4{\%}ofspeciation events in flowering plants and 7{\%} in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one ofthe more predominant modes ofsympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. Theoretical models sup- port the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. The evidence sug- gests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.

@article{Wood2009,
abstract = {Since its discovery in 1907, polyploidy has been recognized as an important phenomenon in vascular plants, and several lines of evidence indicate that most, if not all, plant species ultimately have a polyploid ancestry. However, previous estimates of the frequency of polyploid speciation suggest that the formation and establishment of neopolyploid species is rare. By combining information from the botanical community's vast cytogenetic and phylogenetic databases, we establish that 15{\%} of angiosperm and 31{\%} of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase. These frequency estimates are higher by a factor of four than earlier estimates and lead to a standing incidence of polyploid species within genera of 35{\%} (n = 1,506). Despite this high incidence, we find no direct evidence that polyploid lines, once established, enjoy greater net species diversification. Thus, the widespread occurrence of polyploid taxa appears to result from the substantial contribution of polyploidy to cladogenesis, but not from subsequent increases in diversification rates of polyploid lines.},

The infant was delivered at 33 weeks 4 days of gestation because of severe fetal growth restriction. The birth weight was 1,108 g, and multiple malformations were present. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated a karyotype of 69,XXY. At the time of this report, she lived at home and was 280 days old. A review of triploid infants revealed that the relatively unique clinical features of triploidy were syndactyly of the third and fourth fingers and abnormal erythrocyte indices. The associated karyotypes were 69,XXX and 69,XXY but not 69,XYY. Two of five infants died of pneumonia. Two infants, including the infant described herein, developed infantile spasms after the age of 200 days. Triploid infants with long-term survival are at high risk of developing pneumonia and infantile spasms.},

abstract = {Polyploidy is the heritable condition of possessing more than two complete sets of chromosomes. Polyploids are common among plants, as well as among certain groups of fish and amphibians. For instance, some salamanders, frogs, and leeches are polyploids. Many of these polyploid organisms are fit and well-adapted to their environments. In fact, recent findings in genome research indicate that many species that are currently diploid, including humans, were derived from polyploid ancestors (Van de Peer {\&} Meyer, 2005). These species that have experienced ancient genome duplications and then genome reduction are referred to as paleopolyploids. This article discusses the mechanisms underlying polyploidy, and both the advantages and disadvantages of having multiple sets of chromosomes.},

abstract = {Polyploidy, or the presence of two or more diploid parental genome sets within an organism, is found to an amazing degree in higher plants. In addition, many plant species traditionally considered to be diploid have recently been demonstrated to have undergone rounds of genome duplication in the past and are now referred to as paleopolyploids. Polyploidy and interspecific hybridisation (with which it is often associated) have long been thought to be important mechanisms of rapid species formation. The widespread occurrence of polyploids, which are frequently found in habitats different from that of their diploid progenitors, would seem to indicate that polyploidy is associated with evolutionary success in terms of the ability to colonise new environmental niches. A flurry of recent genomic studies has provided fresh insights into the potential basis of the phenotypic novelty of polyploid species. Here we review current knowledge of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes associated with polyploidy in plants and assess how these changes might contribute to the evolutionary success of polyploid plants. We conclude by stressing the need for field-based experiments to determine whether genetic changes associated with polyploidy are indeed adaptive.},

One contribution of 14 to a Theme Issue 'Contemporary and future studies in plant speciation, morphological/floral evolution and polyploidy: honouring the scientific contributions of Leslie D. Gottlieb to plant evolutionary biology'. Polyploidy is a mutation with profound phenotypic consequences and thus hypothesized to have transformative effects in plant ecology. This is most often considered in the context of geographical and environmental distributions as achieved from divergence of physiological and life-history traits-but may also include species interactions and biological invasion. This paper presents a historical overview of hypotheses and empirical data regarding the ecology of polyploids. Early researchers of polyploidy (1910s-1930s) were geneticists by training but nonetheless savvy to its phenotypic effects, and speculated on the importance of genome duplication to adaptation and crop improvement. Cytogenetic studies in the 1930s-1950s indicated that polyploids are larger (sturdier foliage, thicker stems and taller stature) than diploids while cytogeographic surveys suggested that polyploids and diploids have allopatric or parapatric distributions. Although autopolyploidy was initially regarded as common, influential writings by North American botanists in the 1940s and 1950s argued for the principle role of allopolyploidy; according to this view, genome duplication was significant for providing a broader canvas for hybridization rather than for its phenotypic effects per se. The emphasis on allopolyploidy had a chilling effect on nascent ecological work, in part due to taxonomic challenges posed by interspecific hybri-dization. Nonetheless, biosystematic efforts over the next few decades (1950s-1970s) laid the foundation for ecological research by documenting cytotype distributions and identifying phenotypic correlates of polyploidy. Rigorous investigation of polyploid ecology was achieved in the 1980s and 1990s by population biologists who leveraged flow cytometry for comparative work in autopolyploid complexes. These efforts revealed multi-faceted ecological and phenotypic differences, some of which may be direct consequences of genome duplication. Several classical hypotheses about the ecology of polyploids remain untested, however, and allopolyploidy-regarded by most botanists as the primary mode of genome duplication-is largely unstudied in an ecological context.},
